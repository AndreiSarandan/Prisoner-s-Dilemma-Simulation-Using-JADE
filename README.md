# Prisoner-s-Dilemma-Simulation-Using-JADE
Developed a simulation of the Prisoner's Dilemma using the JADE (Java Agent DEvelopment Framework), which allows the creation of multi-agent systems. The project consists of two main types of agents: ArbitratorAgent and PrisonerAgent, each responsible for different roles within the simulation.
